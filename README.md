# Excel-to-MySQL-Capstone-Project

 In this specialization, I will complete a Capstone Project using data analysis to recommend a method for improving profits for a company, Watershed Property Management, Inc. Watershed is responsible for managing thousands of residential rental properties throughout the United States. My job is to persuade Watershed’s management team to pursue a new strategy for managing its properties that will increase their profits.
 
 Watershed currently has a time-sensitive opportunity to explore the short-term rental market with one of its top property owners, who has expressed interest in working with Watershed to convert some of its long-term rental properties to short-term rental properties. They require me, as their business data analyst, to:

(1)	calculate how much it would cost to convert and maintain each of this client’s properties as a short-term rental.

(2)	determine the nightly rental price that would maximize the profits from each of these properties, if they were converted to short-term rentals. 

They would then like me to use this information to:
(3)	calculate which properties would have increased profits as short-term rentals.

(4)	determine how profitable, overall, it would be if Watershed converted some of this client's properties into short-term rentals.

(5)	determine how much cash Watershed would need in order to realize any potential profits from converting the properties. 

I will also have to synthesize this information into a succinct business recommendation: 

Should Watershed enter the short-term rental market using some of this client’s property portfolio, or not? If so, which properties should be converted first?
